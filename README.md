## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   GeeksForGeeks
   Google

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
     This project has given me various problems that I’ve had to work through and understand.
   I haven’t had experience with JavaScript before and the many functions and properties that comes with it.
   Because of my inexperience, I had trouble with the functions in the project that allowed the game to perform the tasks that it does.
   I had to learn how the getElementById and classList functions worked together to perform a certain task on
   whatever element that was passed into the getElementById function. Also, though I have had experience with HTML,
   I was unfamiliar with CSS and some of the processes to modify the elements shown in this project.
   For example, to access certain ids in the CSS file to modify certain elements you must have their id name following a # symbol,
   then write in the body what you would like to change about that element.
   The main challenge I had during my time working on this project was creating the guess function.
   Even with the assistance of the flow chart provided, I was unsure of how I should use the variables that I had
   created to fulfill my algorithmic task of creating the game. I had trouble finding a way to create statements that would
   go to the next check to proceed through the rounds of the game. This was until I thought of using embedded if statements to
   dig down into the options provided by the chart. I also created associated else statements for those if statements to cover
   the scenario of if the condition in the if statement weren’t true. To overcome all of these difficulties I used Google,
   GeeksForGeeks, and the information provided in the directions for the project to assist my thought process and education of
   the project’s subject matter.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

     This project has exposed me to various subject matter on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
   This exposure has made me really appreciate the work put into web development in this current day and age.
   It has also sparked some interest in me about web development.
   I would like to know what other kinds of websites I could create, or what other elements
   I can include on a website to make them more interactive or make them easier to navigate.
   I would also like to know the full process of creating a website so that in the future
   I will have the skill and experience to create my own.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

     If I had more time to work on this project I would definitely want to implement more functions, buttons, and sequences.
   For example, to be more creative I would want to add a level feature to the game.
   After completing one level correctly a player would move on to another one.
   In the next level another button would be added to the game area and would be a part of a new sequence.
   Another idea that I would like to implement if time permitted is having a random algorithm choose what button
   would be next in the sequence instead of having a fixed sequence every game cycle.
   One last idea that I would want a part of this project is allowing a player to have multiple lives.
   I think if I advanced the other parts of the game as I mentioned previously that the player would need more chances to fail.
